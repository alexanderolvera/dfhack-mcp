# farming

> The fort's farm plots and seed stock as facts: the early-survival pipeline between "what's plantable" and "what's in stock."

## Purpose
`stocks` sees food *outputs* (meals, drink) and `game_data` knows what's plantable *in the abstract* (a plant raw's `farm_plantable` flag), but nothing saw the pipeline in between: which plots exist, what's actually assigned to grow in them each season, and whether there's seed on hand to plant it. An AI co-pilot calls this to catch an idle plot (no crop assigned in any season) or, by joining a plot's `crop` against `seed_totals[]`, a crop assigned with zero seed in stock — before either becomes a food crisis — and to compose with `game_data`'s plant dossiers for a full picture of what a crop needs.

## Parameters
None.

## Returns
- `plots[]` — one row per farm plot (capped at 200 — see `plots_total`/`plots_truncated`): `{ id, size, surface, seasons[], no_crop_assigned, no_eligible_crop }`.
  - `size` — tile count (`width * height`).
  - `surface` — true if the plot's tile is open to the sky, false if underground.
  - `seasons[]` — always 4 entries, one per `SPRING`/`SUMMER`/`AUTUMN`/`WINTER`: `{ season, crop?, eligible? }`. `crop` (a plant token, e.g. `"MUSHROOM_HELMET_PLUMP"`) and `eligible` are both absent when that season is fallow (no crop assigned). When a crop IS assigned, `eligible` is whether the plant raw's own season flag allows it to grow in that season. Seed stock for `crop` is NOT repeated here — look it up in `seed_totals[]`, the single source for that fact.
  - `no_crop_assigned` — true iff every season is fallow — a plot doing nothing.
  - `no_eligible_crop` — true iff no season holds BOTH an assigned crop AND `eligible: true` — a strict superset of `no_crop_assigned` (a plot can have every season "filled" and still trip this if none of the assignments are actually eligible for their season).
- `plots_total` (number), `plots_truncated` (boolean) — the real plot count and whether the 200-row cap dropped any.
- `seed_totals[]` — `{ plant, count }`, fort-wide seed counts by plant, sorted by plant token. Only plants with at least one seed in stock are listed. Excludes forbidden/dumped/rotten/under-construction/trader-bound seed items. This is the ONLY place seed counts appear — join a season's `crop` token against it rather than expecting a per-plot count.

## Caveats & limits
- Returns `{"error":"no fort loaded"}` when no fort is active.
- `eligible` checks ONLY the plant raw's own season flag (`SPRING`/`SUMMER`/`AUTUMN`/`WINTER` — does DF consider this plant plantable in this season at all). It does NOT check surface/underground depth compatibility: live verification found a plant flagged surface-only via `underground_depth_min == underground_depth_max == 0` (`REED_ROPE`) successfully planted in an underground plot in the fixture — `underground_depth_min`/`max` describe where a plant grows WILD, not farm-plot eligibility, so asserting a depth/surface rule here would have been actively wrong rather than merely incomplete. Compose with `game_data`'s plant dossier `surface`/`depth_min`/`depth_max`/`biomes` fields if you need those facts directly, without this tool implying they gate plantability.
- Seed counts live ONLY in `seed_totals[]` — a season's `crop` is not paired with a per-plot count (an earlier revision repeated the fort-wide `seed_totals[]` figure under every matching plot/season, which was pure duplication of a fact already in the same payload, not new information).
- `surface` is read from the plot's own anchor tile's map designation, not inferred from a fort-wide surface z-level — accurate per-plot even in a fort with plots at mixed depths.
- `plots[]` is capped at 200 rows; `plots_total`/`plots_truncated` track the real count regardless.

## Implementation notes
Plots come from `df.global.world.buildings.other.FARM_PLOT`; each plot's `plant_id[0..3]` indexes `df.global.world.raws.plants.all[]` and maps to season by DF's standard farm-plot convention (index 0-3 = spring/summer/autumn/winter), `-1` meaning fallow. `eligible` reads that plant raw's `flags[SEASON]` boolean directly — confirmed live against every crop this fixture had already assigned (all matched their season flag). Seed counts come from `df.global.world.items.other.SEEDS`, summed by `mat_index` (the same raw index as `plant_id`) with the same forbidden/dump/rotten/construction/trader/garbage_collect exclusion `stocks` uses. `surface` reads `dfhack.maps.getTileBlock(...).designation[lx][ly].outside` at the plot's `(x1, y1, z)`. Confirmed live on DFHack 53.15-r2 against the Dreamfort fixture (all 30 plots underground, `outside=false`).
